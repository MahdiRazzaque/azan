# Task 16: Security Review and Authentication - Summary

## Overview
We conducted a comprehensive security review of the Azan Dashboard application, focusing on authentication requirements for all API endpoints. The review aimed to ensure that sensitive configuration data is properly protected while maintaining accessibility for public endpoints.

## Accomplishments

### 16.1: Review Authentication on New Endpoints
- Reviewed all API endpoints in the application
- Verified that all sensitive endpoints require authentication via the `requireAuth` middleware
- Confirmed that public endpoints are accessible without authentication
- Added authentication requirement to the `/api/logs/clear` endpoint which was missing it

### 16.2: Test Authentication Bypass Prevention
- Created a comprehensive test script (`tests/security-review.js`) to verify authentication requirements
- Tested various authentication bypass attempts:
  - Empty token
  - Invalid token format
  - SQL injection attempts in token
- All bypass attempts were correctly rejected with 401 Unauthorized responses

### 16.3: Verify Setup Modal Accessibility
- Implemented a new `/api/config/status` endpoint to check if setup is needed
- Ensured the setup endpoint is accessible without authentication
- Created a new `setupConfigRoutes` function in `src/config/config-routes.js`
- Updated `server.js` to use the new config routes

### 16.4: Security Testing of Configuration Handling
- Added a protected `/api/config` endpoint that requires authentication
- Implemented sanitization of sensitive data in configuration responses
- Verified that configuration data is properly protected

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoints Security
- **Public Endpoints**: Accessible without authentication
  - `/api/prayer-times` - Get prayer times
  - `/api/prayer-source-info` - Get prayer source info
  - `/api/features` - Get features
  - `/api/prayer-sources` - Get available prayer sources
  - `/api/prayer-source/timezones` - Get valid timezones
  - `/api/logs` - Get logs
  - `/api/logs/stream` - Stream logs
  - `/api/logs/last-error` - Get last error
  - `/api/test-mode` - Get test mode
  - `/api/auth/status` - Check auth status
  - `/api/config/status` - Check setup status

- **Protected Endpoints**: Require authentication
  - `/api/prayer-times/refresh` - Refresh prayer times
  - `/api/prayer-source-settings` - Get prayer source settings
  - `/api/prayer-source/validate/mymasjid` - Validate MyMasjid Guild ID
  - `/api/prayer-source/validate/aladhan` - Validate Aladhan Parameters
  - `/api/prayer-source/validate` - Validate prayer source settings
  - `/api/prayer-source` - Update prayer source
  - `/api/prayer-source/test` - Test prayer source connection
  - `/api/logs/clear` - Clear logs
  - `/api/features` - Update features
  - `/api/test-mode` - Update test mode
  - `/api/auth/logout` - Logout
  - `/api/config` - Get config

### Authentication Implementation
- The application uses token-based authentication
- Tokens are generated upon successful login and stored in the client's localStorage
- The `requireAuth` middleware verifies the token in the `x-auth-token` header
- Sessions have a configurable timeout and are cleaned up periodically

### Setup Modal Accessibility
- The setup modal is accessible without authentication
- The `/api/config/status` endpoint checks if setup is needed based on:
  - Existence of the config.json file
  - Validity of the configuration format
  - Presence of required configuration fields

## Testing
The implementation was tested using a comprehensive test script (`tests/security-review.js`) that:
1. Tests all endpoints with and without authentication
2. Verifies that protected endpoints return 401 Unauthorized when accessed without authentication
3. Confirms that public endpoints are accessible without authentication
4. Tests authentication bypass prevention
5. Verifies setup modal accessibility

All tests passed successfully, confirming that authentication is properly implemented across the application.
