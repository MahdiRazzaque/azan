# Task 10: Server Initialization Logic Update - Summary

## Overview
We have successfully updated the server initialization logic to handle missing or invalid configuration files and defer prayer scheduler initialization until setup is complete. This task involved modifying the server startup process to gracefully handle various scenarios and provide a smooth setup experience for new users.

## Accomplishments

### 10.1: Add config.json existence check at startup
- Enhanced the `initialiseServer` function in `src/server/server.js` to properly check for the existence of config.json
- Added clear logging to indicate when configuration is missing or invalid
- Ensured the server continues to start and serve the setup modal when configuration is missing

### 10.2: Defer scheduler initialization
- Created a new `initializePrayerServices` function to separate prayer-dependent service initialization from server startup
- Added a flag to track whether prayer services have been initialized
- Implemented proper dependency chain for initialization (config validation → prayer data source → scheduler)
- Created an API endpoint `/api/initialize-services` to trigger initialization after setup is complete

### 10.3: Handle invalid prayer_times.json files
- Enhanced the prayer file validation logic to handle invalid files
- Added proper error handling and recovery for missing or corrupt prayer_times.json
- Ensured prayer data source initialization creates a new prayer_times.json if needed

### 10.4: Test complete initialization flow
- Created a comprehensive test script `tests/server-init-test.js` to verify the initialization logic
- Tested server startup with missing config.json
- Tested server startup with invalid config.json
- Tested initialization of prayer services after setup
- Added backup and restore functionality to preserve user configuration during testing

## Implementation Details

### Server Initialization Flow
1. When the server starts, it checks if config.json exists and is valid
2. If config.json is missing or invalid, the server continues to start but defers prayer service initialization
3. The setup modal is displayed to the user in the frontend
4. After the user completes setup, the frontend calls the `/api/initialize-services` endpoint
5. The server then initializes the prayer data source and scheduler with the new configuration
6. The page is reloaded to display the properly initialized dashboard

### Key Components
- **Server Initialization Logic**: `initialiseServer` function in `src/server/server.js`
- **Prayer Services Initialization**: `initializePrayerServices` function in `src/server/server.js`
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/initialize-services` for triggering initialization after setup
- **Frontend Integration**: Updated `setup-modal.js` to call the initialization endpoint after setup
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test script in `tests/server-init-test.js`

## Benefits
- **Improved User Experience**: New users can now set up the application through the web interface without encountering errors
- **Robustness**: The application gracefully handles missing or invalid configuration files
- **Reliability**: Prayer services are only initialized when proper configuration is available
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of server startup and prayer service initialization

## Next Steps
With Task 10 completed, we can now move on to Task 11: Frontend Prayer Display Updates, which will focus on updating the frontend to display prayer times and source information from the new schema.
