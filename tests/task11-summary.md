# Task 11: Frontend Prayer Display Updates - Summary

## Overview
We have successfully updated the frontend to display prayer times and source information from the new consolidated prayer_times.json format. This task involved modifying the frontend code to properly read and display prayer times from both MyMasjid and Aladhan data sources, showing source-specific information in the UI, and ensuring proper handling of both azan and iqamah times.

## Accomplishments

### 11.1: Update prayer time reading logic
- Enhanced the `updatePrayerData` function in `public/app.js` to fetch and process prayer times from the consolidated format
- Updated the API endpoint in `src/prayer/prayer-times.js` to return a consistent data structure with startTimes and iqamahTimes
- Ensured proper handling of the nextPrayer calculation and display

### 11.2: Add source information display
- Added a new section in the HTML to display prayer source information
- Created CSS styles for the prayer source info section to display it nicely
- Implemented the `updatePrayerSourceInfo` function to render source-specific information:
  - For MyMasjid: Display mosque name and guild ID
  - For Aladhan: Display geographical coordinates and calculation method

### 11.3: Handle iqamah time display
- Updated the prayer times table to display both start times and iqamah times
- Ensured proper formatting and styling of the time displays
- Added visual indicators for passed prayers and the next upcoming prayer

### 11.4: Test with both data sources
- Created a comprehensive test script `tests/frontend-display-test.js` to verify:
  - The prayer_times.json data structure
  - The API endpoint response format
  - The presence of source information in the API response
- Tested the frontend display with both MyMasjid and Aladhan data sources

## Implementation Details

### API Endpoints
- Enhanced `/api/prayer-times` endpoint to include source information
- Added a dedicated `/api/prayer-source-info` endpoint for retrieving source details

### Frontend Components
- Added a prayer source info section that displays:
  - An icon representing the source type (mosque for MyMasjid, globe for Aladhan)
  - The source name (MyMasjid mosque name or "Aladhan")
  - Source-specific details (guild ID for MyMasjid or coordinates/calculation method for Aladhan)

### Styling
- Added new CSS styles for the prayer source info section with appropriate spacing, colors, and layout
- Ensured the design is consistent with the rest of the application

## Testing
The implementation was tested with both MyMasjid and Aladhan data sources to ensure:
- Correct display of prayer times
- Proper source information display
- Accurate iqamah time handling
- Responsive design across different screen sizes

All tests passed successfully, confirming that the frontend correctly displays prayer times and source information from the consolidated schema.
