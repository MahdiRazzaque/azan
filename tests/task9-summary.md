# Task 9: Backend API Routes for Settings - Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented backend API routes for saving and retrieving prayer time source settings. This task involved creating endpoints for configuration management, implementing validation logic, adding robust configuration save and data refresh mechanisms, and ensuring proper authentication protection for all sensitive endpoints.

## Accomplishments

### 9.1: Create prayer source configuration endpoints
- Created comprehensive set of API endpoints for prayer source configuration:
  - GET `/api/prayer-source-info`: Public endpoint to retrieve current prayer source information
  - GET `/api/prayer-sources`: Public endpoint to list available prayer sources
  - GET `/api/prayer-source-settings`: Protected endpoint to retrieve all prayer source settings
  - GET `/api/prayer-source/timezones`: Public endpoint to get valid timezone options
  - POST `/api/prayer-source/validate/mymasjid`: Protected endpoint to validate MyMasjid Guild ID
  - POST `/api/prayer-source/validate/aladhan`: Protected endpoint to validate Aladhan parameters
  - POST `/api/prayer-source/validate`: Protected endpoint for comprehensive validation
  - POST `/api/prayer-source`: Protected endpoint to update prayer source settings
  - POST `/api/prayer-source/test`: Protected endpoint to test connection to prayer sources

### 9.2: Implement parameter validation on server side
- Created `prayer-source-validator.js` module with comprehensive validation for prayer source settings
- Implemented timezone validation in `timezone-validator.js`
- Added validation for both MyMasjid and Aladhan parameters
- Implemented detailed error reporting with field-specific validation errors

### 9.3: Add configuration save and data refresh logic
- Created `prayer-config-manager.js` module with robust configuration management:
  - Implemented transaction-like behavior for configuration updates
  - Added backup and restore functionality to prevent data loss
  - Enhanced error handling with detailed error reporting
  - Added support for preserving settings for inactive sources
- Created test script to verify configuration save and data refresh functionality

### 9.4: Ensure admin authentication protection
- Added `requireAuth` middleware to all sensitive endpoints
- Created clear separation between public and protected endpoints
- Documented authentication requirements for all endpoints
- Created authentication protection documentation

## Files Created/Modified
- Created: 
  - `src/prayer/prayer-config-manager.js`: Robust configuration management
  - `src/utils/timezone-validator.js`: Timezone validation utility
  - `tests/prayer-config-refresh.test.js`: Test for configuration refresh
  - `tests/auth-protection.test.js`: Authentication protection documentation

- Modified:
  - `src/prayer/prayer-source-routes.js`: Updated to use new modules and add authentication
  - `src/prayer/prayer-source-validator.js`: Enhanced validation logic

## Benefits
- **Improved Reliability**: Transaction-like behavior with backup/restore prevents data corruption
- **Enhanced Security**: All sensitive endpoints are protected with authentication
- **Better User Experience**: Detailed validation with specific error messages
- **Maintainability**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- **Robustness**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Next Steps
With Task 9 completed, we can now move on to Task 10: Server Initialization Logic Update, which will build on our work to improve the application's startup behavior.
